    <h1>Compound Assignment Examples</h1>

    <p>
      Compound assignments in JavaScript are shorthand ways of combining an
      arithmetic operation with an assignment operation. These operators
      simplify code by performing both the operation and assignment in one step.
    </p>

    <p>Here are a few examples:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Addition and Assignment (<code>+=</code>):</strong>
        <pre><code>let num = 10;
num += 5; // Equivalent to: num = num + 5;
// Now num is 15</code></pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Subtraction and Assignment (<code>-=</code>):</strong>
        <pre><code>let total = 100;
total -= 20; // Equivalent to: total = total - 20;
// Now total is 80</code></pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Multiplication and Assignment (<code>*=</code>):</strong>
        <pre><code>let price = 50;
price *= 2; // Equivalent to: price = price * 2;
// Now price is 100</code></pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Division and Assignment (<code>/=</code>):</strong>
        <pre><code>let quantity = 8;
quantity /= 2; // Equivalent to: quantity = quantity / 2;
// Now quantity is 4</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Compound assignment operators enhance code readability, especially when
      performing multiple operations on a single variable. They execute the
      arithmetic operation and assign the result to the variable in a single
      step.
